# Stardew Valley - Cooking and Ingredients Tracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 
version 17.0.5 by [IfThenCreate](https://linktr.ee/ifthencreate). 

Still a work in progress! Feel free to suggest improvements or open an issue. 

## Possible Future Updates
- [ ] Maybe add "type" of recipe source, so you can sort by that (even if it's not displayed)
- [ ] Add filters to Ingredients Table to look at only certain categories at a time
- [ ] Track or filter loved items? Would be nice to know what to cook for gifts
- [ ] Maybe add a toggle to display the recipes how they show up in game?
- [ ] Maybe add a filter to hide cooked recipes from the recipe list

## Development 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
